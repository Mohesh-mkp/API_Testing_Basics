# Introduction

### API stands for Application program interface.
API acts as a communication medium where two applications can interact with each other irrespective of their platform or technology.

### Basic Roles and Responsibility of API: 
* To fetch the data from the backend and display it on the front end
* Take data from the front end and store it in the backend

__Example__   
If a person opens google and searches hotel in search bar:
The role of API is, It take the hotel from the search bar as input and fetch data from the database of Google and display it on the screen.

## Types of APIs:
There are two types of API.   
1. Simple Object Access Protocol (SOAP) **->** Old technology and support for XML format.
2. Representational State Transfer (REST)

__Note:__   
API on the web is known as **Webservice**. All webservices are API but not all APIs are webservices.   
When API is developed locally and tested and if successfully moved to production or web environment then it is known as webservice.   
Webservice needs internet whereas API doesn't require any network for operation.
