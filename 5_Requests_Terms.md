## Things to know for API Testing
What API do we know, that we need to request the server regarding the data like whether we need to retrieve data or add data or update or delete the data.   
Now we have the idea that for API testing the basic requirement from the user is to send a request to the server/database and we have 4 particular types of requests, **GET, POST, PUT, and DELETE**.   
The other things to know are the **Request payload, Response payload and Status code**.     

__Request Payload__: The data passing through the request    
__Response Payload__: The response data from the requests    
__Status Code__: The status code represents a number that will state whether the request is successful or not.    

### Creating HTTPS requests:

### Naming Request:

### Selecting request type:

### Sending URL for get request:

So query parameter is the parameter where the data is represented.

In this example:

Equivalent param that are relevant to data or requests are stored in the param section.


Now when you send the data, here's the thing you will receive:

__Status code:__

Also, there is an option to clear the response as well
